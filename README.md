# What is this web app?

This is a chat room where you and your friends can join a room and talk about anything you want. 

# How to run

1. Open your terminal
2. Enter "nodemon server.js"
3. Open your localhost and hopefully it should work!

# Drawbacks

1. Chat history disapears after reloading the page


# Happy Coding!
